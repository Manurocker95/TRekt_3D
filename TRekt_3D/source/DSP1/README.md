# DSP1

Simple program that can be added in pretty much any 3ds homebrew, that will make sure the DSP firm is dumped, so you can use the ndsp module for sound

## License

DSP1 is licensed under the MIT license, created by zoogie and modified by LiquidFenrir to work as a "library"

## Usage

Include the `dsp.h` file and call `ensureDSP()`. Do NOT call ndspInit before. Only after.

## Changes

All I did was remove things, and make it not work as its own application. Use it as a git submodule or something.
